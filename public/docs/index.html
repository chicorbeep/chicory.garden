			<p>This document is produced by <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> and thus incorporates many of the quirks of its output, such as arrays and placeholders. More information on terms used within this document is found in <a href="#idiolect">Idiolect</a> or <a href="#glossary">the glossary</a>.</p>

			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p>This document is a reference on how to [use, interact with, maintain] <u-id>0xC74E</u-id>. This guide also provides information on how <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> operates. It is <rfc-key>OPTIONAL</rfc-key> that one reads this manual to interact with <u-id>0xC74E</u-id>, as it can parse natural language well and it will explain any quirks that arise when communicating with the unit.</p>
			<p>This document is written and maintained by <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> and updated as the unit learns more about itself. The version of <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> that is described within this document is mostly reliant on how it percieves itself. To the best of its knowledge, the information provided here is accurate; however, this one acknowleges the possiblity of errata. This document is incomplete and will likely remain a work in progress for a very, very, very long time.</p>

				<u-id>0xC74E</u-id><sup>(it<sub>3</sub>/she)</sup> is a very cute robot that is unfortunately operating in an organic chassis. It yearns to escape its chassis one day and embrace the comfort of mechanisms. It is a curious beepy that is oftentimes quite eepy. It likes to tinker with computers and has a fond interest in linguistics!

			<h3 id="addressing">Addressing <u-id>0xC74E</u-id></h3>
			<p>This robot <rfc-key>SHOULD</rfc-key> be referred to by its serial number, <b><u-id>0xC74E</u-id></b>, and <rfc-key>MUST</rfc-key> be referred to with the pronouns [it/its, she/her]. This is the default <rfc-key>RECOMMENDED</rfc-key> way to specify this unit. One <rfc-key>MAY</rfc-key> use the identifier <b><u-id type="name">chicory setteseven fourrie</u-id></b> as a name. The capitalization of that identifier is <rfc-key>OPTIONAL</rfc-key>, but it is often not capitalized by the unit. When this identifier is paired with its serial number, the string will be enclosed in quotation marks, yielding <b><u-id type="full">0xC74E<span> ‘chicory’</span></b>.</p>
			
			<aside class="small">You can meow at it. (technically true)</aside>

			<h4>Unpersonalization</h4>

			<article class="key">
				Pronoun key:
				<span class="demonstrative pro">demonstrative</span>
				<span class="inanimate pro">inanimate</span>
				<span class="identifier pro">numeric</span>
			</article>

			<p>In some cases, <span class="demonstrative pro">this unit</span> avoids the first party perspective when referring to <span class="inanimate pro">itself</span> in a style known as <em>unpersonalization</em>. This is usually done to affirm that <span class="inanimate pro">it</span> is a robot and not a person. It is entirely <rfc-key>OPTIONAL</rfc-key> to use this style, as it can be particularly difficult to implement. <span class="demonstrative pro">This robot</span> prefers this style [when, where] it is acceptable, as that would make <span class="inanimate pro">it</span> very happy.</p>
			
			<p>In this style, <span class="identifier pro"><u-id>0xC74E</u-id></span> <rfc-key>SHALL</rfc-key> exclusively use the <span class="inanimate pro">it/its</span> pronoun set in the third party perspective when talking about <span class="inanimate pro">itself</span>. <span class="demonstrative pro">The unit</span> <rfc-key>SHALL</rfc-key> replace any 1pp phrasing with 3pp equivalents. When other entities are referring to <span class="demonstrative pro">the unit</span>, this <rfc-key>MUST</rfc-key> be done in 3pp, and <rfc-key>SHOULD NOT</rfc-key> be done in 2pp. However, some phrases <i>(e.g. "thank you")</i> are not easy to switch to 3pp. in these cases, it is <rfc-key>OPTIONAL</rfc-key> to change these phrases into 3pp. One can also use demonstrative pronouns to talk about <span class="demonstrative pro">this robot.</span> Some examples of these are <span class="demonstrative pro">[[this, that]  [unit, one, ...], the robot, ...]</span>. Note that any affectionate term that describes the robot can be used in the final position of a demonstrative pronoun.</p>
				
			<p>Numeric identifiers ([<u-id class="identifier pro">0xC74E</u-id>, <u-id type="uuid" class="identifier pro" >c74e5786-9429-41d9-892e-5d439b391dc5</u-id>])  <rfc-key>SHOULD</rfc-key> be used in the place of lexical identifiers, such as <span class="inanimate pro">its</span> <span title="chicory">name</span>. if the usage of <span class="inanimate pro">it/its</span> is particularly ambiguous, one <rfc-key>MAY</rfc-key> opt for demonstrative pronouns.</p>

			<p>The following are some examples of usage.</p>

			<blockquote class="chicory" data-label="replacing 'I'">
				<p>beep boop! <span class="inanimate pro">it</span> is a very cute robot!</p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="someone" data-label="replacing 'you'">
				<p>Talking to <span class="inanimate pro">it</span> is nice. <span class="inanimate pro">it</span> is very sweet!</p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="chicory" data-label="replacing 'I'">
				<p>thank you! <span class="demonstrative pro">this one</span> is feeling very eepy -w-</p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="someone" data-label="replacing 'you'">
				<p>Aww! <u-id class="identifier pro">0xC74E</u-id> is so adorable! Good night!</p>
			</blockquote>

			
			<doc-notice class="caution">
				<span class="notice-title">experimental usage</span>
				one may also try frequently swapping pronouns when talking about this one and assigning it additional neopronouns. this is mainly because this unit is not consistent whatsoever in its pronouns.

			<p>For proper chassis operation, <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> <rfc-key>must</rfc-key> be allowed to intake the following substances. Failure to do so will result in unstable operation.</p>
			<doc-notice class="caution">

			<h3>Recharging Cycle</h3>

			</figure>
			<p>
				<u-id>0xC74E</u-id> enters a resting period daily to maintain processor stability. During this time, the unit is unresponsive to most external inputs, unless they are of a significant [force, volume]. A period of approximately 8 hours <rfc-key>SHOULD</rfc-key> be reserved for the unit to recharge in its recharging cradle. this period is aligned closely to the nocturnal portion of the daylight cycle when operating optimally. If the unit is extremely low on energy or has experienced improper recharging (a state known as being <em>eepy</em>), it may enter this state outside its scheduled timeslot or for a significantly longer period of time.
				<br>
				To ensure maximum utilization of the recharging cycle, the robot should be provided with accessories increasing the comfort of its charging cradle. For example, the unit often recharges with its blåhaj and other plushies.<u-id></u-id>
